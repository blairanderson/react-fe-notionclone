# React Notion Clone [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/blairanderson/react-fe-notionclone/tree/master/)

This was a test to get a simple-looking task list into another app of mine, and now wanting to see how much closer i can get to the notion feeling.

### TODOs

- [x] drag / drop of tasks and sub-tasks
- [ ] "enter/return" key at the end of a line should open a new block immediately below
- [ ] "enter/return" key in the middle of a line should split text into separate blocks (cut all text from cursor to end of line and paste into new block below)
- [ ] "delete" key at beginning of block should merge current block and previous block
- typeing "- " (dash space) should convert the block into a list element
